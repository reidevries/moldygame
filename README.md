# moldygame
game where  u r a mold
it uses Raylib (compiled with a linux dynamic library, not included).
I have forked this to a new repo called CopyCat, and removed the files specific to this game.
CopyCat will have a more full-featured 2D sprite based game engine, which I will probably reuse for this project if I come back to it.
